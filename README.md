Random Quote Display

HTML and CSS was provided. Quote shown is randomply selected from an array and then dynamically fills in the quote and source based on what information about the quote is available (year, who said it, what did they say it in, et cet...) The quote changes automatically after a fixed time and when the quote changes it will randomly pick a different color to fill the background with.
